1.) What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a **decentralized, distributed ledger technology** that securely records transactions across multiple computers. It consists of a series of **blocks**, each containing a list of transactions, linked together in a **chain** using cryptography.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralization** – No central authority controls the data; it’s shared across a network.
- **Transparency** – Transactions are visible to all participants, ensuring trust.
- **Immutability** – Once recorded, data cannot be altered, making it highly secure.
- **Smart Contracts** – Self-executing contracts with predefined conditions.

### Applications:
- **Cryptocurrency** – Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on blockchain for secure transactions.
- **Supply Chain** – Tracks goods from production to delivery.
- **Voting Systems** – Enhances security and prevents fraud.
- **Healthcare** – Securely stores patient records.
  
Blockchain is revolutionizing industries by enabling trust and efficiency without intermediaries. Are you exploring it for cryptocurrency or another purpose?

2.) What is Hyperledger Fabric?

Hyperledger Fabric is an **open-source, enterprise-grade blockchain framework** designed for building **permissioned distributed ledger solutions**. It is part of the **Hyperledger project**, hosted by the **Linux Foundation**, and is widely used for **business applications** requiring security, scalability, and modularity.

### Key Features:
- **Permissioned Network** – Unlike public blockchains, Fabric requires participants to be authorized.
- **Modular Architecture** – Allows customization of components like consensus mechanisms and identity management.
- **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)** – Supports business logic execution within the blockchain.
- **Privacy & Confidentiality** – Enables private transactions between specific participants.
- **Scalability & Performance** – Optimized for high transaction throughput.

### Use Cases:
- **Supply Chain Management** – Tracks goods and ensures transparency.
- **Financial Services** – Facilitates secure transactions and settlements.
- **Healthcare** – Protects patient data and streamlines record management.
- **Government & Identity Verification** – Enhances security in digital identity systems.


3.) Hyperledger Fabric sample code GITHUB REDME

Hyperledger Fabric Samples
You can use Fabric samples to get started working with Hyperledger Fabric, explore important Fabric features, and learn how to build applications that can interact with blockchain networks using the Fabric SDKs. To learn more about Hyperledger Fabric, visit the Fabric documentation.

Note that this branch contains samples for the latest Fabric release. For older Fabric versions, refer to the corresponding branches:

release-2.2
release-1.4
Getting started with the Fabric samples
To use the Fabric samples, you need to download the Fabric Docker images and the Fabric CLI tools. First, make sure that you have installed all of the Fabric prerequisites. You can then follow the instructions to Install the Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images in the Fabric documentation. In addition to downloading the Fabric images and tool binaries, the Fabric samples will also be cloned to your local machine.

Test network
The Fabric test network in the samples repository provides a Docker Compose based test network with two Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below. You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see the test network tutorial.

The Kubernetes Test Network sample builds upon the Compose network, constructing a Fabric network with peer, orderer, and CA infrastructure nodes running on Kubernetes. In addition to providing a sample Kubernetes guide, the Kube test network can be used as a platform to author and debug cloud ready Fabric Client applications on a development or CI workstation.

Asset transfer samples and tutorials
The asset transfer series provides a series of sample smart contracts and applications to demonstrate how to store and transfer assets using Hyperledger Fabric. Each sample and associated tutorial in the series demonstrates a different core capability in Hyperledger Fabric. The Basic sample provides an introduction on how to write smart contracts and how to interact with a Fabric network using the Fabric SDKs. The Ledger queries, Private data, and State-based endorsement samples demonstrate these additional capabilities. Finally, the Secured agreement sample demonstrates how to bring all the capabilities together to securely transfer an asset in a more realistic transfer scenario.

Smart Contract	Description	Tutorial	Smart contract languages	Application languages
Basic	The Basic sample smart contract that allows you to create and transfer an asset by putting data on the ledger and retrieving it. This sample is recommended for new Fabric users.	Writing your first application	Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java	Go, TypeScript, Java
Ledger queries	The ledger queries sample demonstrates range queries and transaction updates using range queries (applicable for both LevelDB and CouchDB state databases), and how to deploy an index with your chaincode to support JSON queries (applicable for CouchDB state database only).	Using CouchDB	Go, JavaScript	Java, JavaScript
Private data	This sample demonstrates the use of private data collections, how to manage private data collections with the chaincode lifecycle, and how the private data hash can be used to verify private data on the ledger. It also demonstrates how to control asset updates and transfers using client-based ownership and access control.	Using Private Data	Go, TypeScript, Java	TypeScript
State-Based Endorsement	This sample demonstrates how to override the chaincode-level endorsement policy to set endorsement policies at the key-level (data/asset level).	Using State-based endorsement	Java, TypeScript	JavaScript
Secured agreement	Smart contract that uses implicit private data collections, state-based endorsement, and organization-based ownership and access control to keep data private and securely transfer an asset with the consent of both the current owner and buyer.	Secured asset transfer	Go	TypeScript
Events	The events sample demonstrates how smart contracts can emit events that are read by the applications interacting with the network.	README	Go, JavaScript, Java	Go, TypeScript, Java
Attribute-based access control	Demonstrates the use of attribute and identity based access control using a simple asset transfer scenario	README	Go	None
Full stack asset transfer guide
The full stack asset transfer guide workshop demonstrates how a generic asset transfer solution for Hyperledger Fabric can be developed and deployed. This covers chaincode development, client application development, and deployment to a production-like environment.

Additional samples
Additional samples demonstrate various Fabric use cases and application patterns.
